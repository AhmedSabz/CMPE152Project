CMPE 152 Project: x86 Assembly Compiler
This project involves designing a compiler in Python for CMPE 152. The goal is to create a tool that can validate x86 assembly language code.

The compiler will:

Use a context-free grammar (CFG) to define the structure of valid x86 assembly code.
Generate parse trees to analyze and verify the correctness of the assembly language.
This project demonstrates the principles of compiler design, including syntax analysis, grammar creation, and tree-based parsing.
